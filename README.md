# sik-johnny-five

This is my attempt at reimagining the examples from the [Sparkfun Inventor's Kit Guide](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Kits/RedBoard_SIK_3.2.pdf) using [johnny-five](/rwaldron/johnny-five) for NodeJS.

I attempt to stay true to the strategy of the examples, except in cases where the code is really ugly.  Usually there are more convenient ways to accomplish the example tasks with the `johnny-five` API, so in some cases I've implemented the same example using two different strategies.  And then in some cases I'm just fooling around.

I make use of Promises here, which `johnny-five` does not natively support.
